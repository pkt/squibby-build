You should have space on your hard disk to create a new disk partition
of at least 5 gigabytes to install a standard Squibby desktop system or
at least 500 megabytes for a minimal server installation. You'll need
more disk space to install additional packages, depending on what you
wish to do with your new Squibby Linux system.

Squibby Linux is based on Ubuntu, so see the Ubuntu Installation Guide
